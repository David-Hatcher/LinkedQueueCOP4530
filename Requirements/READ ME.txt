this is what i think the programs output should resemble.
I was thinking of making a requirements list about the code but I feel like that is already explained in the PDF.
and if anything the programers would probably do it better and faster.
but I will do that if you guys want me to.
I think this covers every case.
please feel free to tell me if i missed something or if i made a mistake.
